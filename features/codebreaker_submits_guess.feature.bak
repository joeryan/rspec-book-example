Feature: codebreaker submits guess

The codebreaker submits a guess of four colored pegs.
The game marks the guess with black and white "marker" pegs.

For each peg in the guess that matches the color and position
of a peg in the secret code, the mark includes one black peg.
For each additional peg in the guess that matches the color 
but not the position of the secret code, a white peg is added
to the mark.
